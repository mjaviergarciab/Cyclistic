The main objective of this project is to reveal the trend(s) in the usage of the different types of Cyclistic’s users focused to answer the question “How are annual partners and occasional cyclists different from using Cyclistic bikes?” by analyzing Cyclistic’s historical cycling data. Once these trends have been identified, share the findings to the main stakeholders of this project (Lily Moreno and the Cyclistic Executive Team) and develop a recommendation based on those findings so a marketing strategy can be formulated and implemented successfully.
